===============

Smaller Chunk of Nepal's OSM Data for OSMAnd updated Monthly

##What is this ?
If you are using OSMAnd and would like to avoid downloading the data for whole Nepal this repo provides you an option to download the data for individual cities. The available cities are those with considerable map data available. If your city is not present and you would like to add it just create an issue or shoot me an email.

##Data Update Interval
I will try to update the data every month. The repo contains folders with the date data was downloaded. I will keep 5 different data and delete the data in the sixth month.

##What is OSMAND ?
If you dont know about OSMAnd then you can find about it here http://osmand.net/ and download it from here https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand&hl=en . 

##How do i use the file?
To use the file simply download it and put it in your osmand folder in your phone.
